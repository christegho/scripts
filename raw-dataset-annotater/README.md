# src

This repository contains scripts to run necessary transforms and
post-processing for the data produced from UE4 in preparation for training ML
classifiers.

## setup
From a bash or zsh shell inside this folder ('src'), run:
```
source setup.sh
```
This command will create a Docker image with the necessary dependencies
installed, and spin up a bash shell inside a Docker container created from 
that image. The Docker image will not rebuild if it already exists in your 
local image list.

### From 'raw' to annotated dataset
Annotations are exported 'raw' from a game engine simply as an image that
consists of another render pass, where pixels that include an object of
interested are a non-black colour. Each separate object is coded with
a different colour.  There is currently no semantic to encode multiple
different objects of interest in a raw annotation.

Ensure that the exported images are organised with the following folder
structure:

.
+-- img
|   +-- img1.png
|   +-- img2.png
+-- raw_ann
|   +-- img1.png
|   +-- img2.png


The original image should be in the 'img' folder, and the mask should be a file
of the same name in the 'raw_ann' folder.

Once you have confirmed that the folder is organised correctly, adjust the
variables that are templated in `run.sh` for input and output paths
appropriately. Then, inside the docker container (entered via the command
above), run: 
```
sh run.sh
```

This will convert the masks that UE4 produces to [Supervisely's annotation
format](https://docs.supervise.ly/import/local_files/supervisely/). See the
variables that are templated inside `run.sh` and adjust accordingly for
different input and output paths, dataset names, and label names.
